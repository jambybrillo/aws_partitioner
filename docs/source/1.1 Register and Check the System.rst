.. note::

   Before creating an account, make sure you are using a valid mobile number because adding a mobile number is required to create a new account on Amazon.in, while adding a location email only is optional.

You can sign in to Your Account at any time by clicking Your Account at the top of each page. You just need to enter the same Mobile number or Email address and Password to access your account.
